                                    **Data Analysis Website**
This project is a web-based data analysis platform designed to allow users to upload CSV files, perform various data analysis tasks, and visualize results through a user-friendly interface. The website leverages Django as the web framework and Pandas for data manipulation, offering a comprehensive suite of features tailored for data exploration and preprocessing.

Key Features:
File Upload and Storage:

Users can upload CSV files, which are then stored securely on the server.
Each uploaded file is associated with a unique session ID to facilitate subsequent data analysis operations.
Data Preprocessing and Analysis:

Data Display: View the entire dataset in a tabular format.
File Information: Display metadata about the file, including column names, data types, and non-null counts.
Descriptive Statistics: Compute and display summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
Null Value Handling: Identify and handle missing values, with options to fill or drop them.
Visualization Tools:

Scatter Plots: Visualize relationships between two numerical variables with options to differentiate by categorical variables.
Line Plots: Plot trends over time or other continuous variables.
Box Plots: Display the distribution of a dataset and identify outliers.
Histograms: Show the frequency distribution of a numerical variable.
All plots are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and are displayed directly on the website.
Interactive Data Selection:

Users can select which columns to analyze or visualize, allowing for tailored insights based on their specific needs.
Options for setting different plot parameters and styles to enhance the readability and interpretability of the visualizations.
Session Management:

User sessions are managed to maintain state across different data analysis tasks.
Users can return to their analysis without needing to re-upload files, ensuring a seamless workflow.
Technologies Used:
Django: For building the web framework and handling HTTP requests and responses.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For generating visualizations.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: For creating the front-end interface, with responsive design considerations to enhance user experience across different devices.
This project aims to provide a robust, interactive, and user-friendly platform for data analysis, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise. Whether for academic, professional, or personal use, this website enables efficient data exploration and insightful visualizations, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
