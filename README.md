3. **Visualization Tools**
   - **Scatter Plots**: Visualize relationships between two numerical variables with options to differentiate by categorical variables.
   - **Line Plots**: Plot trends over time or other continuous variables.
   - **Box Plots**: Display the distribution of a dataset and identify outliers.
   - **Histograms**: Show the frequency distribution of a numerical variable.
   - **All plots are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and are displayed directly on the website.**

4. **Interactive Data Selection**
   - **Users can select which columns to analyze or visualize, allowing for tailored insights based on their specific needs.**
   - **Options for setting different plot parameters and styles to enhance the readability and interpretability of the visualizations.**

5. **Session Management**
   - **User sessions are managed to maintain state across different data analysis tasks.**
   - **Users can return to their analysis without needing to re-upload files, ensuring a seamless workflow.**
